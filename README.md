# Pet-dashboard

This app helps pet-owners to track the important information about their pets, so they can quickly access it whenever they need it, or share it with dog-sitters, friends and vets.

This project is developed with React.js and Firebase. If you have any questions or ideas regarding the app feel free to message me at your convenience!
